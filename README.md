1. Scikit-learn is used to implemented  machine learning models and stacking models
   https://scikit-learn.org/stable/
2.SMOTETomek is used to combine undersampling and oversampling to handle imbalanced data
https://imbalanced-learn.org/stable/references/generated/imblearn.combine.SMOTETomek.html   
3. SHAP explainers is used to interpret the model that provides local and global explanations.

5. Matplotlib.pyplot is used to plot ROC curve.
   https://matplotlib.org/3.5.3/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.html
7. A stratified sampling method was used to divide the dataset into two parts: 70\% training and 30\% testing.
8. Evaluation metrics are used to evaluate ML models. Stacking models are compared with different ML models: RF, LR, DT, SVM, NB, and ensemble models: bagging, boosting, and  voting. The results of each feature selection methods to select 15 optimal features are presented. The results of applying models to selected features by REF, Chi2, and based-tree feature selection are presented.
